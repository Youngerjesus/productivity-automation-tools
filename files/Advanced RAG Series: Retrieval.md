# Advanced RAG Series: Retrieval

## 핵심 논지와 이유

### 핵심 논지 1
Retrieval is the process of getting something back from somewhere, involving steps such as query transformation, indexing, and improving the quality of retrieval.

#### 이유
The process of retrieval involves multiple steps such as query transformation, indexing, and post-retrieval techniques to ensure the quality of the retrieved data. By improving the quality of retrieval, it enhances the relevance and accuracy of the information presented to the LLM, leading to better performance in terms of cost saving, latency, and overall accuracy.

### 핵심 논지 2
Various techniques such as RankingReranking, LostInTheMiddleReranker, Cohere Rerank, bge-rerank, mxbai-rerank-v1, RankGPT, Prompt Compression, LongLLMLingua, RECOMP, MEMWALKER, RAG-fusion, CRAG, and FLARE are used to improve retrieval quality and optimize performance.

#### 이유
The utilization of various techniques such as RankingReranking, LostInTheMiddleReranker, Cohere Rerank, bge-rerank, mxbai-rerank-v1, RankGPT, Prompt Compression, LongLLMLingua, RECOMP, MEMWALKER, RAG-fusion, CRAG, and FLARE is essential to enhance the quality of retrieval and optimize the performance of the LLM. Each technique serves a specific purpose in improving the relevance, diversity, and accuracy of the retrieved information, ultimately leading to better outcomes in terms of cost saving, latency reduction, and overall accuracy.

### 핵심 논지 3
Improving retrieval quality can lead to significant improvements in cost saving, latency, and accuracy, by mapping to the specific use case and data type.

#### 이유
Enhancing the quality of retrieval not only ensures better accuracy and relevance of the retrieved information but also results in significant benefits such as cost saving, reduced latency, and improved overall performance. By aligning the retrieval process with the specific use case and data type, organizations can optimize their resources, enhance efficiency, and achieve better outcomes in terms of information retrieval and processing.
